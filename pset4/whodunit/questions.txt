1.  stdint.h is a header file in the C standard library introduced in the C99 standard library that provides a set of typedefs 
that specify exact-width integer types, together with the defined minimum and maximum allowable values for each type, using macros.
2.  Using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program gives you control over the size of each type.
3.  8 bits, 32 bits, 32 bits, 16 bits.
4.  0x42 0x4D in hexadecimal, BM in ASCII.
5.  "bfSize" is the size of the file in bytes while "biSize" is the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER.
6.  It means that the origin of the bitmap is on the upper-left corner.
7.  The "biBitCount" is the field that defines the bitmap color depth.
8.  The file doesn't exist or the file exists, but you don't have permissions.
9.  Because all information is stored in only one unit of the type. 
10. 3
11. Sets the file position of the stream to the given offset.
12. This is the position from where offset is added, in this case SEEK_CUR is the current file pointer position.
