0.  According to Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary,

pneumoconiosis caused by inhalation of very fine
silicate or quartz dust.
1.  getrusage() returns resource usage measures for who, which can be RUSAGE_SELF, RUSAGE_CHILDREN or RUSAGE_THREAD.
2.  struct getrusage has 16 members.
3.  We pass "before" and "after" by reference because, otherwise the getrusage() function would create local copies of "before" and 
"after" inside the scope of getrusage() and any modifications made by the function would have no effect on "before" and "after"
outside the function.
4. The c = fgetc(fp) is the most important thing in the for loop, the fgetc gets every character until it reaches the EOF. 
Each character is tested if it is an alphabetical character or an apostrophe and not at the index 0 of the word, if so, the 
character is appended to the word[], else if the character is a digit the word is consumed while the characters are alphanumerics, 
that is, fgetc gets every character, not appending any to word[], until reach a space or something that's not an alphanumeric 
character, else if the next character is not an alphabetical character, an apostrophe nor a digit, we must have reached the end of 
the word, so we terminate the word by adding \0 to word[].
5.  It is better to use fgetc because fscanf may interpret punctuation and numbers as a word and make things more complicated, 
as well as read strings that are longer than LENGTH and cause a segmentation fault.
6.  With const we prevent changes to the dictionary we're using and the word we're checking.
